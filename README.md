# Artwork
Banners, logo and wallpapers will be uploaded here.

Banners and logo must be used as specified in the *Artix Brand Book*. Please, do not directly modify the files in the **logo** directory, they should serve only as templates. Anything derivative must go into  **icons** or elsewhere.

*Artix_logo_square_frame.svg* in **icons** is a slightly modified signet with completely square frame, used to generate the desktop icons, in order to prevent various toolkits from arbitrarily stretching the signet.
